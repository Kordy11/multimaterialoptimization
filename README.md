# MULTIMATERIAL TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION

As the topic of my master's thesis I worked on multimaterial topology optimization of a beam loaded statically (cantilever) or dynamically (modal) consisting of one (singletop) or multiple (multitop) materials.

Initialization of topology optimization is done via script __init__.py in all cases.

All codes are written in Python 3.0 programming language.

prerequisities:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- cv2

Feel free to use the code and don't hesitate to ask or give me feedback.
